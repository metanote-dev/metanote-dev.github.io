First, pick a Git tool you like on iOS. I use iSh here.

1. Install Git in iSH using the command:
   : apk add git openssh
2. Configure Git with your username, email, and public key, just as you would on the command line.
3. Create a folder named "orgfiles" in the "On My iPhone" directory using the "Files" app.
4. In iSH, create a directory and mount "orgfiles" to the iSH file system using the commands:
   : mkdir orgfiles 
   : mount -t ios . orgfiles 
   Follow the prompts in the iPhone's file manager.
5. Clone your Git repository into the "orgfiles" directory using Git commands.
6. In Metanote, add the "orgfiles" folder in the "Edit Locations" section of the "Files" tab. Make it the default location if you frequently use it.

That's all!
