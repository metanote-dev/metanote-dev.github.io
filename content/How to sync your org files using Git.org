Choose a Git tool on iOS that you like, here I'll use PolyGit as an example.

1. In PolyGit, create or clone a repository, then proceed to the next step.
2. Open Metanote, swipe from the left edge to open the file manager. In the top left corner, choose "Edit Location," and click the "+" to add a new location.
3. In the system file selection that pops up, choose "My iPhone" -> PolyGit -> "The Repository You Just Cloned," then click "Open" in the top right corner.
4. When adding an external location for the first time, Metanote will parse each file's to-do items and generate a to-do list and agenda view. If your files are not numerous, this process will only take a few seconds. If you primarily use this folder, set it as the default location.
5. When files change externally, such as pulling new content, due to performance considerations, Metanote currently doesn't automatically parse newly changed files. You can manually refresh by pulling down in Metanote's file management or clicking the "Sync" button to actively handle changed files. Note that this will only affect the update of to-do lists and agenda views; it won't impact the content of the files themselves. In other words, even if you don't manually refresh, the files are still up-to-date when you open them in Metanote.

That's all!
